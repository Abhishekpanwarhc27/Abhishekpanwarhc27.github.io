        <p>"Get down at Silver City and then the R.T.O will be right beside it," said Vishwas hastily. "But how will I know where the Silver City is?" Vishwas looked at the passenger irritably and yelled "It's a big mall, it's impossible to miss" and he pushed his way through the alley. "Jaakhan, Jaakhan, Jaakhan, get down people at Jaakhan, Jaakhan, Jaakhan. Not you- yellow shirt, you will get down at the next stop" and he pushed his way right next to the driver. The driver was a Sikh man working an early shift today. He seemed a little less joyful than usual; it was supposed to be his day off, but he had to work as the other driver had called in sick. Bollywood music was playing on the loudspeaker full blast, and the driver was swaying his head to the music.</p>

        <p>Today, it was hotter than an average Dehradun-Monday. The cars were marching like little ants to their destinations, the school children were hurrying on their scooters, the college kids were revving their motorcycles without a care about this world. The hawkers had set their stalls and were selling all kinds of things, ranging from momos, paranthas, juice- to flowers, cashews, and cheap shirts. There was chaos all around, yet the sparrows were flying high in the sky, unperturbed by the pandemonium below.</p>

        <p>Vishwas had a bundle of 10- and 20-rupee notes in between his fingers. He kept the coins in his pockets as they were safer there. "Bhaiya DIT," said the college kid. "10 rupees, and it won't go directly you'll have to switch at Kishan Chowk," said Vishwas and handed him the pink ticket. "Don't lose this or you'll have to buy the ticket again." He got up and started pushing his way through the crowd again- "KC, KC, KC, KC." The bus would speed and then suddenly the driver would hit the brakes hard. Then someone would get on the bus and it would speed again, then again, the driver would hit the brakes hard and this time someone would get down from the bus.</p>

        <p>This was the city bus; it did not have designated stops. Every time someone from the streets would stick their hand out - the driver would stop, and every time a passenger yelled 'Stop', the driver would hit the brakes. Although 'Stop' might not be the right word to use, because the bus would only slow down, and the passengers were expected to jump on and off-board. The bus was painted blue, with white stripes and had a passenger capacity of twenty. But this bus always boasted of at least 40-50 passengers. The lucky ones would be sitting, the ones who couldn't get a seat would be standing, and the toughest ones would be hanging by the door with a better half of their body suspended outside.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Hello, Mr. D.I.T, is this your first day, don't you know people who are standing are not supposed to wear their bags on the back, give it to someone who has a seat, quick," said Vishwas while handing out the change to the old woman.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The bus usually had college kids, school kids, men and women going to work, and other sorts of people going from one end of the city to another. The only other local transport available in the city was an auto-rickshaw but it's fare was priced at a much higher value than the bus, hence most people preferred the city bus. The bus would always be cramped with people hence Vishwas would have to push his way from the back end of the bus to the front. And then again from the front to the back and then again to the front. This was his whole day. This job was not for the lazy, the faint-hearted, or the dim-witted. It involved walking up and down the aisle, giving tickets to people, collecting change, helping with directions, keeping an eye out for people who were trying to get away without paying, and sometimes also getting into altercations with passengers. But 8 years in this job had taught Vishwas a lot, he had learned every lesson of this trade and was a better conductor than anyone else in the City Bus Service (or at least that's what he believed).</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>Vishwas had dropped out of school and had wandered around the country for a while, he had picked up some odd jobs but eventually, his Uncle managed to get him this job. Initially, he was reluctant but then when he heard that it would pay him 15000 rupees per month, he had latched on to this opportunity. He was not a very tall boy but was blessed with good looks. His hair was his biggest asset. Time to time, he would slide his fingers in between his hair and made sure that they always stayed in place. He kept a pocket mirror with him, but his job made it difficult for him to pull out the mirror from his pocket, so he would just set his hair using the reflection on the windowpane.</p>

        <p>Soon after getting the job, his marriage was arranged. When Vishwas heard that the girl had a B.Ed. (bachelor's in education) degree he had become interested. His Uncle explained to him how a government teacher could earn 30000 rupees as a fresher, and that had sealed the deal for him. He had gone through with the marriage and soon enough had two kids.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>The bus 'stopped', and a passenger walked in, this was unusual as the bus only stopped for old women, kids, or people with crutches. This passenger didn't fit in any of these categories. This passenger had walked in and managed to secure a 'seat' for herself in a fully crowded bus. Someone had gotten up and offered his seat to her. Chivalry was not dead after all. But it was dead when- an old lady had asked the same gentleman for his seat, and he had pretended like he couldn't hear her over his earphones. The bus would usually stink, as people would sweat and often spilled things on the floor. They only cleaned the bus weekly, so the smells stayed intact all throughout the week, only to be reset at the end of the week. But today, the back seat of the bus had smelled like fresh rose petals. This passenger had changed the aroma in this section of the bus. The earphones had come off, the perspiration on the forehead had been cleaned, the ties had been adjusted; everyone had become more sober than they were, before the arrival of this passenger. Vishwas was in the front of the bus trying to get to the back. He fought his way back and was about to ask for the ticket, but his eyes froze at the new passenger who had seated herself.</p>

        <p>She was wearing a white 'salwar kameez' with a blue 'dupatta', her hair was down, and she was wearing big earrings. She had a satchel bag on her lap and her sunglasses were covering her beautiful eyes. Although it was not very common to see a pretty girl in this bus, every few weeks there would be a random girl who would show up and get some of the heads to turn. But this passenger's alluring beauty had not been the only reason that had made Vishwas's heart skip a beat. There was more than just that. Vishwas tried to move his gaze away and asked her for a ticket without directly looking at her.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Oh, I am so sorry, I am not carrying any cash with me," said the passenger in a sweet voice. "Actually, my car broke down and I had to park it on the roadside. I was getting late for my class, so I quickly jumped onto the bus. I forgot to check whether I had any money on me or not."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Vishwas had heard these excuses before but he always knew better than to believe in such phony stories. Except today, his heart had softened a little and he had believed this girl, even before she had finished the sentence.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"It's okay Ma'am you can pay me some other time".</p>
        </div>

        <p>He turned around and was about to leave but felt someone grabbing his arm. His eyes widened, and his heart skipped a beat for the second time today.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Vishwas" and then there was a little pause, "Vishwas Kaushal, right."</p>
        </div>

        <p>He forced himself to turn around and heard a familiar voice calling his name. He smiled sheepishly and said,</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Yes, Prarthana."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Oh my god, how long has it been, like what 10 years".</p>
            <p>"9 years, 4 months, and 24 days," said Vishwas confidently.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Prarthana gave a mock laugh.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Wow, it's so nice to see you, I thought I would never see you again".</p>
            <p>"Yeah me too," said Vishwas.</p>
            <p>"Aren't you too old to be studying at D.I.T" joked Vishwas.</p>
            <p>"Of course, you idiot, I am the Humanities Teacher there, I was on my way to the office when my car broke down and that's why I had to take the bus. What about you, what are you up to?" said Prarthana.</p>
            <p>"Well I am at work and you are sitting in my office," said Vishwas sarcastically.</p>
        </div>

        <p>She cried with laughter.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Wow, I see you haven't lost your humor."</p>
        </div>

        <p class="thought">Wow, I see you haven't lost your beauty, thought Vishwas.</p>

        <p>The bus was swaying from left to right and jerking and stopping and then swaying again. But these two had lost track of time and had been chatting like long lost friends. Some of the people had used this opportunity and had gotten down off the bus without paying for the ticket but that had also not dissuaded Vishwas. She told him that she had topped the Board examinations in their school, had gone to Delhi University to pursue an Honor's in English, and furthermore had pursued her master's from England. She had come back to get some hands-on experience. He told her how about his job, wife and kids. They went on to talk for the rest of the journey.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"I love them, they are so cute," said Prarthana looking at Vishwas's children's photograph that he had pulled out from his wallet. "They are handsome just like their dad," said Prarthana, Vishwas gave a sheepish smile. "But why had you left school all of a sudden?" asked Prarthana.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Vishwas hesitated a little and said</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Actually my father had gotten sick, he was bedridden, I had to stay at home and take care of him. He was unable to go to work so I had to quit school and start working."</p>
            <p>"Oh! That's too bad. I missed you when you were gone."</p>
            <p>"You missed me?" asked Vishwas surprised.</p>
            <p>"Yes, of course, you were one of my best friends".</p>
            <p>"Who me, I was your best friend?" asked Vishwas.</p>
            <p>"Yes, you Vishu, you-you- you," said Prarthana mockingly pointing at his chest.</p>
        </div>

        <p>No one had called him Vishu in years, it was something only Prarthana would address him by.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Yes, I also missed you," said Vishwas looking down at the floor.</p>
            <p>"Then why didn't you ever call" teased Prarthana.</p>
            <p>"I was going to, but then I got busy with other things."</p>
            <p>"And I also thought that you would be busy with Bhavesh".</p>
            <p>"Who?" replied Prarthana.</p>
            <p>"Bhavesh, your boyfriend".</p>
            <p>"Oh yeah, Bhavesh, wow almost forgot about him. Yeah, we broke up the next year you left, never heard from him ever again" said Prarthana almost trying to excavate a faint memory.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"You broke up!" said Vishwas exasperated. "But you said that both of you were meant to be together; and you both would get married the day you guys graduate from High School".</p>
        </div>

        <p>Prarthana started laughing hysterically.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Vishwas we were 16, we were stupid, I said a lot of stuff. But that didn't mean I was going to do everything I said."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Vishwas gave a forced smile-</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Oh, you are right, we were just sixteen; we said and did a lot of stupid stuff".</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Gosh, my stop is here. I should get down and let you get back to work, I have taken a lot of your time today. But make sure you call me, don't disappear like last time" said Prarthana and got off the bus. "And yes, thanks for the free ride, Vishu", said Prarthana and left.</p>
        </div>

        <p>"Malsi, Malsi, Malsi, next stop is Malsi" yelled Vishwas. He was watching the trees run past him. This was the same route that he traversed every day, yet there seemed to be something different about it. Prarthana's image had stayed in his heart, her voice reverberated in his ears, her aroma had stayed on the bus even after she had left.</p>

        <p class="thought">So, she didn't marry Bhavesh, in fact, she never got married, thought Vishwas. So, I quit school for nothing, I slit my wrists for nothing, I was admitted in the hospital for nothing.</p>

        <p>He had an embarrassed smile on his face, he felt a small fire in his heart. He walked across the aisle with rejuvenated confidence but suddenly stopped. His eyes stood still at something. In the windowpane he saw his sweaty reflection. His hair was messed up, his dress had stain marks on them, his beard was untrimmed.</p>

        <p class="thought">How could she miss me, I am a school dropout who works as a conductor, she studied in England, teaches at D.I.T.</p>

        <p>He was looking at the piece of paper with her number on it. She had given it to him before leaving.</p>

        <p class="thought">Maybe she just feels bad for me, maybe she was just being kind. I wonder if this is even her real number. Or maybe it is real, she just wants me to come to her house with my family, so that she can see my downtrodden life and pathetic family.</p>

        <p>Vishwas threw the paper with her phone number out of the window.</p>

        <p>"Dilaram-Dilaram-Dilaram, get down Dilaram passengers, get down, get down" shouted Vishwas and went about his day.</p>
