        <div class="historical-note">
            Mussoorie, 1957 - Ten years after Indian independence, many British officials remained in the hill stations, maintaining their colonial lifestyles...
        </div>
        
        <p>On yet another cold winter night Vasu was sitting in front of the fire, most of the nights were cold now, it was December one of the coldest months in Mussoorie. The country had gained independence in 1947, now it was 1957 but there had been very little change in the condition of this town. Vasu was an illiterate, he had never seen the outdoors of a school, his father was a faithful servant to one of the British officers who had served in the Cantonment during the golden days. Vasu had assisted his father in various chores ever since he was a child. He was 17 years old, but he showed very few characteristics of a grown up boy, he had a puny structure, this was probably because of the workload he had had ever since he was a young boy.</p>
        
        <p>His mother had passed away just after giving birth to this little chap therefore his father was his everything, he served his master obediently, and he attended to all his calls, no-questions-asked. He would wake up early to fetch water from the nearby stream and then he prepared the bath for his master, he would cook lunch, then do the dishes and later he was usually sent to the Bazaar to get a cigar for his master. The master was a wealthy man; he had been used to being served and his needs taken care of by the poor town folks. He was a man who believed that servants should be treated according to their ranks; they must serve their masters and later be paid for it, that's it, no further associations must be kept with them. He believed that feelings like love, compassion, friendliness, empathy were not for people of this class. He was a man who believed that poor people belonged to an inferior breed; he believed that he was from a superior class, therefore, it was the poor people's duty to serve him.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>So one fine afternoon, Vasu was sitting on a hilltop, chewing betel leaves, basking under the sun, wearing his worn-out sweater, bare feet on a rock;" Vasu, Vasu", called his father. Vasu got up and ran towards the voice, his father told him to go to the master immediately.</p>
        
        <p>Vasu rushed to his master. Master was sitting there on his wooden chair with his usual demeanor and an uncanny smile. "This is my nephew Jasper, he is here from England. He'll be staying here for a few weeks. I want you to show him around and obey all his orders". Vasu nodded his head in agreement. Jasper was a young lad around 16 years old, but he already looked quite a man. He was tall, fair, and had an expression of warmth on his face. He tried to shake hands with Vasu, but Vasu stepped backwards. He simply bowed down, with one hand on his head and the other behind his back.</p>
        
        <p>Days passed by, and Jasper would go around the hills with Vasu. He enjoyed running to the mountain tops, he loved howling like wolves, they would go to the local stream to catch some fish, and usually ended up with a few. They would go home, and Vasu would fry the fish in mustard oil. Later, after the Master and Jasper were done eating, he would eat a little bit of whatever was left. Over the day, Jasper had been closely observing how Vasu and his father were treated by his Uncle; not just both of them, but when he went out to the club, where his Uncle and a few other retired British officers played poker, he saw how all the Indian servants were mistreated. He found their state miserable, he couldn't help but notice that they weren't just servants but slaves, bound and chained by the shackles of illiteracy and penury. He was from England; this was the first time he had witnessed such treatment. Over the days, his benevolent heart developed sympathy for his master's servant, Vasu. He wanted to help him, but knew there was nothing much he could do, he knew his Uncle well enough to know that his repeated pleas to give better treatment to Vasu would fall dead on his Uncle's ears.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Once, his uncle thrashed Vasu very badly because he had lost the cigar money and had come home empty-handed. He accused Vasu of being careless and useless. There was nothing that Vasu's father could do; he stood there silent with watery eyes. Jasper intervened, he begged his Uncle to let this one mistake pass by and forgive Vasu. Master finally cooled down, he went out of the room and came back with a little more money, and asked Vasu's father to get him a cigar.</p>
        
        <p>Soon, days went by, and now it was time for Jasper to head back to England to attend another semester of school. There wasn't a formal goodbye between Vasu and Jasper, but their eyes conversed better than their tongues could. If someone could read their eye, they would have easily known that the boys already missed each other; they would have known that the two boys shared a bond of true friendship, like the one that is between two princes, but this was a bond between a foreign prince and an Indian slave.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Jasper went back to England, completed his school, and now he is a high school graduate. A year had passed by, and now he was back at his Uncle's house. He was excited to meet Vasu, he wanted to go wandering and roaming around the hills once again with him. When he reached his Uncle's house, he found that there was no sign of Vasu; he had been replaced with another young boy who was equally lean but a little darker in complexion. Vasu's father could also not be seen anywhere. Jasper was perplexed. He enquired of his Uncle about them. "They are gone", said the Master. Jasper couldn't question any further; he thought they might have quit or left the town. But that was hard to believe, they had been here all their lives, this place was their everything, this work was the only thing they knew, so why would they go, why now, why would they quit now? Jasper decided to investigate. He asked the local townsfolk about Vasu and his father. Initially, the townsmen were reticent, but after Jasper's constant enquiries, finally, an old man spoke on the condition of absolute anonymity. He told Jasper, "THEY BOTH ARE DEAD".</p>
        
        <p>"Dead, how could...when ...but", Jasper's mind had myriad questions. But soon all his doubts were cleared, the old man began, "A few months back, the Master lost a big hand in poker; he was furious, he just couldn't swallow the loss. He came back home, sat on his wooden chair and then asked Vasu to make him a cup of tea, Vasu made tea for him, he poured it in a cup and started walking towards the Master but just when he was about to place the teapot on the table he tripped and thus spilt the boiling tea on the master's face. Master's face burnt, he turned red with anger he caught hold of Vasu and slapped him hard, but that wasn't the end of it, he pulled out his stick and started beating him with it, he beat him black and blue, in the process he hit Vasu on the head, his head started bleeding profusely, he fainted. Master left him there unattended, hoping he would get up and leave, but the poor fellow was too scorned to stand. He was lying there for hours before he died a slow, but silent, death".</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Jasper was stunned after this shocking revelation, he did not know what to say, how to react. But suddenly his eyes grew wider and he mumbled "But his father, what about him"?</p>
        
        <p>"His only son's loss was too much for him, he knew exactly what had happened but there was nothing he could do about it, because he was nothing but a slave, a slave who in modern days was called a servant. He wandered around for a few days in agony and later when the pain was too much for him to handle, he jumped into the stream to put an end to his life", uttered the old man.</p>
        
        <p>Jasper found himself equally weak and helpless, he knew everything about the murder but he too could do nothing about it, he couldn't even interrogate his uncle. Every day he saw the new servant Bhanu being mistreated and overworked, he couldn't help but wonder that someday even Bhanu might face the same plight.</p>
        
        <p>Jasper didn't like this place anymore; the place wasn't the same without Vasu. He decided to leave. Arrangements were made and after a week he headed back to England. He still couldn't get Vasu off his mind, but then he cheered himself up by assuming, that now, Vasu was in a better world, a world, where no one is a servant, a world, where every creature is equally treated, a world where only the soul is allowed to go.</p>
