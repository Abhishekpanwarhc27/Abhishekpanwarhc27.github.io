<title> Pari Tibba </title>

<body>
It was past sunset, and Hemant was ready for his journey. A journey that may have
a beginning but no end. The tall oak trees enveloped the hills from all sides. The
stars were twinkling brighter than usual. The crickets were making their nightly
sounds, the monkeys and rabbits had taken cover in their caves and holes, and the
cold air was whistling past Hemant’s ears. He was wrapping his coat tighter but
could still feel the breeze cutting through his skin.
It all started a few weeks ago when Hemant finally made up his mind to make
the ascent to Pari Tibba. Pari means fairy in the local language and this little hilltop
was named after the fairies. It was forbidden to go here, as the fairies were
notorious for keeping handsome boys for themselves, and all the boys who had
dared to go Pari Tibba had never returned. Keeping this in mind the townsfolks had
blocked the entrance to Pari Tibba. They had used a fallen tree and covered it with
a lot of thorny bushes. They had also thrown nettles on top of the tree to prevent
adventurous children from passing through.
‘Adi baba’ was well known for his close relations with the divine. The
townsfolks had a huge regard for him. They had convinced him to tie a talisman at
the entrance to Pari Tibba to contain the fairies in the little hill. Adi baba’s
talisman ensured that the fairies remained trapped inside Pari Tibba and never
bothered the town folks.
No one knew for sure the first time a Pari had abducted someone, but the stories
had been doing the rounds for generations. After dark people didn’t even like to
walk around the path leading to Pari Tibba. Come sunset and everyone would run
helter-skelter away from this place.
Just before the entrance of Pari Tibba was the ‘Dhobhighaat’. This is where
the washermen came to wash bulk loads of clothes for Woodstock School.
Dhobhighaat had a stream that provided a surplus amount of water, hence making
it easy for the washermen to wash big loads of clothes. Some of the washermen
also had little huts at Dhobhighaat which were used to store - washing powder,
change of clothes, some food, and other essential things. All through the day scores
of washermen washed clothes and then hung them on the clothesline for drying.
Even though the washermen had huts here, they made sure to leave before sunset.
Even if some of the clothes were not dry; they would leave them in the hut and
come back the next morning but at no cost did they stay here past sunset.
Hemant had grown up listening to stories about Pari Tibba and fairies. His
grandmother would tell him all sorts of stories of men, who went to Pari Tibba but
never came back. Instead of getting scared of these stories, Hemant found himself
drawn towards this place. Every time his grandmother was finished telling a story,
he would tell her that he will make the ascent to Pari Tibba someday. His
grandmother would rebuke him and ask him to promise her that he will never go
there. He did promise her at that moment. But his grandmother had passed away
last year and with her went his promise.
Hemant, now nineteen, had decided to go to Pari Tibba. He had packed his bag
and had walked from his house to the Dhobighaat. He was staring at the entrance
to Pari Tibba and was ready for an adventure of a lifetime. He was wearing jute
bags on his shoes to avoid the nettles and thorns. It was past sunset, nobody was
around.
He saw the fallen tree and noticed the talisman that was tied to the tree. He felt
the talisman starting at him, he felt a sense of foreboding, but he shrugged it away.
He jumped over it and set foot inside Pari Tibba. This was it, he was in the fairies’
land; he was here, where no human belonged.
His heart was beating fast, he had wanted to be here ever since he was eight
years old, and today he was standing here. He started walking, it was an uphill
road, and the path was full of leaves and grass, as no one had walked there in a
long time. He was amazed to see some of the plants, they were glowing. He had
read about bioluminescent plants in school. But it was something else to see the
plants in real life. The plants seemed like the lights on an airport’s runway, guiding
Hemant for the flight. The entire path was covered with heavy undergrowth. The
trees converged onto each other and seemed like a false ceiling between Hemant
and the sky. The sky was clear, the moon was glowing.
After having walked for an hour, Hemant reached the flat hilltop - Pari Tibba.
He caught his breath, drank some water from his bag, and stood still. He walked a
few more inches toward the edge and could see the whole valley from there. The
city lights in the valley twinkled like stars in the sky. He could hear the hushing of
winds passing the trees, and the silence of the night disturbed by the animals
intermittently.
His eyes adjusted to the dark and he started noticing things around him. He could
see the oak trees, bushes, illuminating plants, and a white structure behind a huge
rock. He went closer and realized it was a shrine. He went up to the shrine and
noticed some writings on the wall
"Flutter, flutter, fairy wings,
Through the forest, hear us sing.
Magic whispers, in the air,
Fairy tale, beyond compare.
Spells and potions, charms so bright,
Guide us through this mystical night.
Gather round, both young and old,
Fairy stories, now unfold
He read the lines out loud. Once he finished reading the lines, he noticed the text
glowing on the wall. The text turned red, burning red. And then he heard a
thunderous roar in the sky. The sky was enveloped in bright white light. He fell to
the ground; he was struggling to keep his eyes open. He noticed a parade of
women flying onto the hilltop. He quickly hid behind the shrine. These women
were no ordinary women. Their skin glowed like pearls. They had white wings
projecting from their back. They had a crown on their head, made of rose petals.
Their eyes had no pupils, and their feet had no toes. They walked gracefully in a
circle. They held hands and started singing in high-pitched voices:
Moonlight dances, shadows sway,
In the darkness, we will play,
Whispered secrets, in the night,
Dark enchantment takes its flight.
Mystic spells, we cast around,
As we dance upon the ground,
Fairy magic, oh so strong,
Spirits rising all night long.
Through the forest, we will glide,
As our magic does collide,
Underneath the moon's bright gaze,
Our enchantments will raise.
We are the fairies,
Mistresses of the night,
Dancing in the moonlight,
Underneath starlight.
They kept singing their song, in their magical voice. Hemant was standing behind
the shrine transfixed. He found himself being hypnotized by the song. He wanted
to stay behind the shrine but found his legs wanting to move forward. He started
walking and kept walking and finally stood in between the circle created by the
fairies. Hemant felt like he had stopped existing, every part of his body seemed
lighter than he had remembered. He had never felt the emotions that he was feeling
right now. He was happy, scared, and mesmerized all at the same time. He kept on
looking at the fairies and he couldn’t tell how many there were. He couldn’t tell if
they all looked the same or different.
Suddenly, the fairies stopped singing and one of the fairies approached him. He
looked at her with curious eyes. “Hello,” she said. “Hello” replied Hemant. “Are
you a fairy?” “That’s what they say” came the reply. “But you look just like us,”
said Hemant. “And what am I supposed to look like”? she asked. Her skin was
glowing. “Is this normal, for your skin to glow?” asked Hemant. “Is it normal for
you to ask so many questions?” hissed the fairy. “Why did you come here, what do
you desire?” asked the fairy curiously in her high-pitched voice. “I have come here
to find the unknown, I have come here to see what no eyes have lived to tell”.
“There is a reason no man has ever made it back.” said the fairy. “Do you kill
everyone who comes here?” asked Hemant innocently. She gave a soft laugh. “We
are fairies, not ghouls. We don’t kill, we don’t capture, men who come here just
never want to leave. We give them the choice of coming with us or going back,
without any recollection of this place. It’s free will.” “So why has no one ever
come back from here alive”? “After having seen what you have seen today, no man
wants to leave. So now, I ask you, do you want to come with us to our land above,
or do you want to go back to what you know”? Hemant hesitated a little and then
spoke resolutely “I haven’t come this far to go back. I am here to know everything
there is to know”. The fairy smirked. She gave a victorious look to the other
fairies. “Come then let’s prepare you for the journey beyond,” said the fairy in a
falsely sweet voice. They all circled him again and started singing:
Another boy here tonight,
Let us give him some insight,
Lost in our circle, you are our prize,
A mortal boy, with innocent eyes,
but do not fear us, do not be afraid,
We are the fairies, the ones who made
This circle of darkness, where we dance and sing,
And the magic that surrounds us, can be a dangerous thing,
But fear not, little one, for we have plans for you,
And the enchantments we weave will be unlike any you knew.
We'll show you things, you've never seen,
Things that are dark, and a little obscene,
We'll whisper secrets, into your ear,
And show you things, that will fill you with fear.
With our magic, we'll take you away,
To a world of darkness, where we'll make you stay,
You'll be our toy, to do with as we please,
And in our fairy circle, you'll never leave.
Hemant felt lighter and lighter until he felt no weight, he started floating. He rose
in the air along with all the fairies and started rising higher and higher. All the
fairies giggled and laughed. Pari Tibba kept getting smaller and smaller as they
kept rising. Hemant got one final glimpse of the place that he had known. Between
the trees, near the shrine, he noticed something lying still on the ground. He could
swear it looked like him, just pale eyes, pale skin, pale everything.
