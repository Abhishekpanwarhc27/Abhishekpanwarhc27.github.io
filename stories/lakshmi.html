    <article>
        <p>At noon the sun was burning and so was her skin. Lakshmi gathered another stack of grass and carefully placed it on her head. She always kept a small piece of cloth on her head, this helped her with cleaning perspiration off her forehead and prevented little insects from entering her ears. Even with a petite figure she was built strong and could carry a lot of grass on her head. It was her second shift today having completed the first one at 5:00 AM. After her morning shift, Lakshmi had returned home, milked the cows, cleaned the house, made breakfast and had tilled the field-as the harvesting season was approaching. And again, she was in the forest fetching more fodder. She had the usual bunch of girls with her – Shobha, Bijla, Vaishnavi and the new bride Ganga.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi was in her eighth month of pregnancy but that did not deter her from her daily errands. Moreover, she was not given a choice.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Is your husband good looking?" asked Lakshmi.</p>
            <p>"I think he had a mustache," said Ganga, who had got a small glimpse of her husband before he had left for work in the neighboring town, the very next day after their marriage.</p>
        </div>

        <p>She wasn't sure if she knew what he looked like, but she wasn't going to mention it to anyone. Ganga was no more than 14 but she looked like a woman already. She was well built and could carry a lot of weight on her head; be it the stack of hay or the 'matka', she was always carrying the most weight. This skill of hers had impressed her mother-in-law so much, that she had agreed to accept her as a bride for her youngest son with a frugal dowry. Since Ganga was from the adjacent village, she knew that even after marriage, it would be possible for her to go back and forth to her parents' house if she ever wanted to, hence she had not shown any reluctance towards the marriage proposal. Not that she could have refused even if she wanted to.</p>

        <p>At 22, Lakshmi had four daughters and no sons. She knew if she was incapable to produce a male heir in this pregnancy - life was going to be difficult for her, and her girls. Her husband had not visited her in six months. She had once overheard her mother-in-law say that he was in Mussoorie and was working as a 'chowkidaar' in one of the hospitals. She wasn't sure where Mussoorie was but her husband had once said that it took a day and a half to get there by bus- first you had to take the bullock cart to the bus station, fifteen hours on the bus and you would reach Uncle Madhur's house and then after spending the night there, you had to take another bullock cart to the Mussoorie station and then walk another hour on foot to reach the hospital. Lakshmi had been missing her husband and was hoping that he is back for the birth of their child.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>Lakshmi and her friends were heading back home and were passing the 'Peepal Tree'. Suddenly, all the women started chanting prayers to their beloved gods. A woman named Saruhi had recently committed suicide by hanging herself on to this tree. She was very young when she had gotten married and had to take care of a fifteen-member family. Somehow, she managed it for three months but when the workload was too much for her to handle, she had decided to take the drastic step. It was common for young brides to commit suicide in Lakshmi's village. Not everyone could handle working eighteen hours a day with little food and no appreciation. It wasn't hard to replace them though, Saruhi's in-laws had got a new wife for their son the very next week and had almost completely forgotten about the 'little incident'. Rumor was that Saruhi's ghost still lived around this tree hence the chanting of prayers.</p>

        <p>It was getting late for lunchtime and Bijla knew that her husband would not be impressed if he wasn't served food at his fixed time. So, she was hastily making her way back home. Most women did not wear slippers. The men would sometimes wear shoes if they were going for work but usually, everyone walked barefoot. The people of the village had been walking barefoot all their lives and now their feet were so coarsened that if ever a thorn would come under their feet it would break in half but would never pierce through their hard skin.</p>

        <p>Most women were covered in jewelry from head to toe. It started with the 'mangteeka' in the parting line of their hair followed by the traditional 'nath' (a big circular ring) that hung from their nose. Their ears had multiple piercings and resembled a dart board full of darts. They wore a 'mangalsutra'(necklace) around their neck and their wrists had an assemblage of bangles. The 'payal'(anklet) around their ankles made a clinking sound every time they moved. The picture would finally be complete with a 'bicchi'(toe-ring) on their toes.</p>

        <p>Most of the jewelry was made of gold with the 'bicchi' and the 'payal' being an exception as those were usually made of silver. Lakshmi was from one of the well-to-do families hence she was clad with the most amount of metal. She would have taken pride in it had it not made her everyday jobs even more unwieldy, but it wasn't something she would have ever complained about.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>Lakshmi came back home, fed the cattle and then she put the pot on the stove and started preparing the meal for the inhabitants of the house. The members included her mother in law; her husband's older but unmarried brother, her husband's nephew and her four unfortunate daughters. The oldest daughter was taking care of the youngest one while the other two were playing and fooling around on the dirty floor. She usually looked at her daughters with disgust and wondered how much better her life would have been had she not had these girls running around, but instead had handsome boys making the house look more resplendent. She wondered what her options will be if her next child is also a girl. She went into deep thoughts and had some macabre ideas run through her mind but then she lunged out of her thoughts because of the wailing of her second youngest daughter.</p>

        <p>The food had been served and her mother-in-law had made the usual comment about the food not being up to the mark and how she and her son's life would have been better off had she married her son to Shakuntala, the Sarpanch's daughter. Shakuntala had instead been married to Jayant Singh and had given birth to three healthy sons. Lakshmi, as usual, ignored the comment and helped her mother in law get up to the bed. After everyone was done eating, Lakshmi sat down to eat and as usual, there was not enough food left for her. And yet again she half fed herself by excavating food from the bottom of the pot.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi was usually not left with enough food to eat because she feared making too much. Her mother-in-law had already reminded her numerous times as to what an inefficient homemaker she was, who didn't ration food properly and how they were supposed to save ration for her brother in law Rajan's wedding. And other times they would have an unexpected guest show up, thereby Lakshmi's share would go to the guest.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>Last year Lakshmi's husband had come back home. At dinner, he observed that there wasn't enough food left for Lakshmi, so he secretly threw a chunk of rice from his plate over to Lakshmi's. Lakshmi loved that sweet gesture and slept with a full stomach that night. But this little act of kindness had not gone unnoticed by the mother-in-law; next morning she made sure that all the old ladies in the neighborhood knew how her son was henpecked by his wife. Lakshmi's husband had also brought her a new sari from Mussoorie. She had a magical glow on her face on receiving the present and she couldn't stop picturing herself in that sari. She felt like a new bride. She was torn when her mother-in-law took the sari away and decided that the sari would be put to better use if it was saved for Rajan's future wife. Lakshmi cried herself to sleep that night.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi had been hearing about Rajan's wedding since the first day of her marriage. Expecting Rajan to get married was like expecting the flowers to blossom in winters. He was a cripple and could not walk at all. He also had a lisp. His mother had been trying to get a lot of girls to marry him but none of the girls would agree. She had even offered to not charge any dowry but even that had not been able to entice any of the village girls. Rajan was his mother's beloved son, she always pampered him, and she could never hear a word against him. Rajan had made Lakshmi's life a little more difficult than it already was, as she had to serve food to him, help him change his clothing, wash his clothes and do all the other little chores for him throughout the day.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi couldn't get much sleep nowadays. The kid inside her womb kept kicking all night and if that wasn't enough, her girls would wake her up for nature calls incessantly during the night. If somehow, she slept through all of that, then her cripple brother-in-law would get thirsty and would ask her to fetch him water. Day or night she was always serving someone. Sometimes she remembered her days as a child, when she did not have to worry about anything and her days would go about carousing in the forests, eating mangoes from trees, swimming in the lake and picking fights with the neighbors. One fine day her grandfather had told her that her days of playing with dolls were over and she should get ready for her marriage next month. She remembered how excited she had been about the idea of dressing up, wearing expensive jewelry and having a new house for herself. All this had happened not too long ago, but it seemed like it was a lifetime ago when she had really been happy. All her dreams and happiness had turned to dust. She couldn't remember the last time when she had lived a day of her life without serving others, or the last time she had had the liberty to express how she really feels or what she really wants to do.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>Lakshmi was in the woods again gathering some firewood with her friends. She had climbed the topmost branch and was chopping the tree's branch with a scythe. She was extremely skilled with a scythe and could chop the whole branch with just a few strokes. Last summer a leopard had found its way to her cattle's shed and she had killed it using the same weapon. The village folks had applauded her bravado, and some had even called her the avatar of Goddess Durga. Lakshmi had felt like a hero and had humbly accepted the title. Lakshmi gathered the pile of wood and softly landed on the ground. She helped Bijla get the load on top of her head. That's when she noticed that Bijla had some bruises on her neck and shoulders. She knew that Bijla's husband used to beat her regularly for trivial reasons but wasn't sure what had happened last night. She was half tempted to ask her the story but later decided against it. She thought she had enough problems of her own and she need not burden herself with other people's problems - this was contrasting of her childhood nature as when she was a child she would willingly find people with problems and convince them to help her solve their problems but of course things were not the same anymore - she felt a little sense of comfort and a tiny bit of relief when she realized that in all her years of marriage her husband or in-laws had never laid hands on her. But a part of her was also envious of the fact that Bijla had given birth to two healthy sons who could take care of her in her old age.</p>

        <p>Vaishnavi looked a little more woebegone than usual. Ganga finally asked her what was wrong.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Yesterday they made me grind the wheat for seven straight hours and after that, I had to spend the night with the cows as one of the cows was getting scared of something. The cows didn't give me any room to sleep. After a tiring night, this morning when I asked my mother-in-law if I could go to my only brother's wedding in my village, she refused. She said that since this was the harvesting season, she could not afford to send her eldest daughter-in-law away, for a 'whole week'" said Vaishnavi wearingly. "It has been three years since I visited my home. I miss my family so much. I had even got a new sari for this occasion and now I'm not even allowed to go.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Lakshmi put her arms around Vaishnavi's shoulders and embraced her.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"A woman's life is full of sacrifices and that's the reason God gave us more strength than men. Even Sita Maiyya had to endure 'vanvaas' for fourteen years. Even Draupati, a queen, had to live the life of an ascetic for several years. If hardship didn't spare such powerful women in history why will it spare us? You will survive this too."</p>
        </div>

        <p>Lakshmi's philosophy gave Vaishnavi little consolation. A few minutes later she said</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"I wonder if God will punish me if I end my life and leave my kids behind. Sometimes I feel life will be so much easier that way."</p>
        </div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"We all have had that thought at some point in our lives. But it is easier said than done. It's not the pain that we are afraid of, neither is it the false love we claim to have for the people we will leave behind. Its 'freedom' we are afraid of. We are apprehensive as we are unsure what freedom will look like, and moreover, we don't even know what we'll do with it once we have it" said Bijla.</p>
        </div>

        <p>Suddenly all the ladies turned their gaze towards her. They all gave some thought to this philosophical statement of hers but then they all started walking back to their designated households humming some random folk songs.</p>

        <p>One would look at these ladies and could never tell that they suffered from any kind of pain or misgivings. They always looked convivial and had a sense of calmness all over their faces. Were they so good at hiding their feelings? Or were they able to find joy in their lives through their kids, husbands, cattle, farm yields, or just other ladies' misfortunes?</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"I'm pretty sure it will be a boy this time," said the midwife.</p>
        </div>

        <p>She would regularly come to Lakshmi and give her an update on her pregnancy. She was an old woman with a hunched back and had been doing this for so long that she could tell from the complexion on a girl's face whether she will give birth to a boy or a girl.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Your face is pinkish this time, last time it was a little yellowish. Your belly also seems protruded downwards this time which is a clear indication of a boy" deduced the midwife.</p>
        </div>

        <p>A smile broke on Lakshmi's face. She started thinking of the pride she would feel if she could produce a male heir for her family. She remembered last time how disappointed her family had been after she had given birth to a fourth girl and how she was forced to go to the postman and have him write a letter to her husband giving him the sad news.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Gold bangles. If it's a boy this time I'll not settle for anything less than gold bangles as my fees" declared the midwife.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>A teenage boy from the neighborhood had been possessed by an evil spirit and all the village folks had gathered around to watch the spectacle. In small villages whenever there's an issue it becomes a spectacle and draws crowds from far and near. This lad had been possessed by one of the girls who had died during childbirth and he had made the mistake of peeing right next to her house the very next day. She had found her way in his body and now was making him scream, jump, dance, run, and cry. He was making weird sounds and was constantly beating himself with metal chains. He was dancing in a non-rhythmic pattern and had smeared his face with red powder. The villagers were trying to control him but to no avail. Lakshmi had obviously been forbidden to attend this spectacle as it was considered an ill omen for a pregnant woman to be a part of such an event. It was believed that pregnancy made a woman vulnerable to supernatural events and there was always a possibility of the evil spirit finding its way into the mother's womb and then haunt the child for the rest of its life. But Lakshmi had sneaked to the top floor of her house and was able to see the whole spectacle through her bedroom window.</p>

        <p>An old woman had just announced herself to the scene. She was making similar maneuvers as the possessed boy, except, her moves seemed more composed and restrained. The village folks believed that whenever an evil spirit found its way in the village, always some 'devta' would enter the body of some noble person and arrive at the scene to rescue them from the situation. Today the 'devta' had chosen Kaushalya Devi; a widow, who lived with her widowed daughter-in-law. Kaushalya Devi was known to be a temporary place of residence of 'Dhansingh Devta'. 'Dhansingh Devta 'was known to frequent her body whenever the occasion called for it and this was an ideal situation for him to make an appearance.</p>

        <p>Kaushalya Devi was escorted to the teenager. There was loud cheering going on. Some villagers had grabbed a 'dhol' and were beating it rhythmically. Kaushalya Devi and the teenager were both swaying to the beats of the drums and were shouting on top of their voices. Seeing Kaushalya Devi march closer, the boy tried to make a futile escape but Kaushalya Devi grabbed hold of him and threw some rice on his face. The rice seemed to have divine power as it started burning his face.</p>

        <div class="dialogue">
            <p>"Leave his body and go back where you came from" roared Kaushalya Devi.</p>
        </div>

        <p>The boy slowly moved his head side by side to imply he wasn't going to oblige. She quickly equipped herself with some red powder and threw it on his face. Now his face started to burn more ferociously. He was making shrieks and was trying to escape but the old woman had grabbed both his hands. She grabbed hold of some turmeric paste and rubbed it on his forehead. That seemed to be the final nail in the coffin. The boy looked up towards the sky, twisted his body, and made a shrill sound and then fell unconscious on the ground. The villagers applauded Kaushalya Devi's efforts in unison. The boy was lifted by the villagers and was carried away. Kaushalya Devi also seemed to have come to herself and was respectfully escorted back to her house. Kaushalya Devi knew that yet again she had saved the day.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi witnessed all this through her window and thought that this was better entertainment than the village play she had seen last year.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>The sky had turned black. It was satiated with clouds. They were roaring with all their fury. The sky glowed every few seconds and thundering roars seemed to have engulfed the whole village. It seemed as if the Gods were having a war and the village folks were witnessing it from down below. It had been incessantly raining for the past fifteen hours. The fields were already flooding, and the water had found its way through the weakly constructed roofing. It seemed like the rain gods had left their taps running and had gone for a carousal. Things couldn't have got worst for Lakshmi as she had just gone into labor. She had had a few contractions and the midwife had been summoned. The experienced midwife examined her and could tell that there was a complication, she knew this delivery was not going to be easy. She asked Lakshmi's mother-in-law to get a few towels and help her with the delivery.</p>

        <p>In a dimly lit room stood the midwife, the mother-in-law, and on the bed lay Lakshmi. Few neighbors from the neighborhood had braved the rain and had come to their house. They were here to babysit Lakshmi's daughters and to also emotionally support Lakshmi. They were trying to stop her daughters from entering the make-shift delivery room. The daughters were getting inquisitive and were trying to figure out what was happening inside the room. Poor Lakshmi was twisting and turning in pain. The child's umbilical cord had got stuck and the midwife was finding it hard to get the child out without hurting the mother. Lakshmi was making cries of agony and the women standing outside the room were trying to fathom Lakshmi's ordeal. Her mother-in-law had rosary beads in her fingers and was constantly praying to God. She was praying- that she finally gets a male heir. The midwife was using all her skills and expertise to make the delivery possible. In her long career as a midwife she had never messed up a delivery and she had no intention of messing this one either.</p>

        <p>Lakshmi's body was starting to give up. She had lost a lot of blood and could feel her lower body getting numb. Her vision was being deterred and she could hardly see anything. She thought that she would die of exhaustion if not of pain. She had already been in labor for four long hours. After a few more excruciating hours, a lot of praying, and years of midwifery expertise. It finally happened.</p>

        <p>Maybe it was the prayers, maybe it was the midwife's skills, maybe it was the child's luck, or it was some other divine help. Lakshmi successfully delivered a healthy baby. The midwife wrapped the baby in a blanket and handed it over to the grandmother. The grandmother and the midwife had big smiles on their faces. The grandmother had got an heir for the family and the midwife was taking home four gold bangles as her reward. Her perfect delivery record still stood strong.</p>

        <p>The rain had ceased. The last time it had rained so much was in Mathura, thousands of years ago and that is when Lord Krishna was born. Therefore, it was a no brainer as to what the name of this baby would be. He was named 'KRISHNA'. He had a bright complexion and was a healthy baby. He looked very handsome just like his father. The grandmother was already seeing a future where Krishna would be running around the house and she would be playfully scolding him. She knew her life was complete. She knew that now she could die in peace.</p>

        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>

        <p>The next morning, rain had ceased, and things had returned to normal. The village started looking more like its usual self. This was the first rain after a long dry spell. The petrichor emanated from the fields and had spread its smell everywhere. The grandmother quickly had a neighbor sent to the post office to have a letter sent to her son telling him about the good news.</p>

        <p>She couldn't control her happiness and thought she would die of excitement. But she knew she had one last business to take care of. She asked her son's nephew Vaidu to make the necessary arrangements. Vaidu had done this before so he knew exactly what to do. He quickly bought all the necessary articles from the market, gathered all the important family and friends, summoned a Brahmin, and that afternoon they quickly and quietly performed the last rites of Lakshmi. She had died a few hours after the childbirth due to excessive blood loss. She had served her purpose and when she lay on the funeral bed wrapped in white, she had looked happy.</p>
