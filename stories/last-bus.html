        <p>A ghost story from the hills of Mussoorie</p>

             alt="A bus parked at night" 
             class="story-image">
        
        <p>Anirudh pulled out a cigarette from the pack. He was disheartened as this would be his last cigarette for the night. He knew he had to enjoy this one thoroughly. Through the puffs of the smoke, he could see the streetlamps flickering. After a tiring day in Dehradun, he was ready to return home. He had already been waiting for an hour at Kuthal Gate. It was half past midnight. He knew there would be no bus at this hour, but he hoped for a taxi or a private car to pass by.</p>
        
        <p>It was a cold winter night. The flickering streetlamps and twinkling stars disturbed the darkness. After what seemed like forever, he saw some gleaming headlights approaching him from a distance. He tried to partially cover his eyes with his hand. When his eyes adjusted to the light, he saw that a Roadways bus had pulled over. Anirudh was surprised to see that the buses were running this late into the night. But he thanked his stars and got on the bus.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>The bus had a clean interior but a rusty smell. It was dimly lit and only half full of passengers. He looked around and found a vacant seat right by the window.</p>
        
        <p>"Where to?" asked the conductor without directly looking at Anirudh. "Picture Palace". The conductor tore a ticket and handed it to Anirudh. "How much?" asked Anirudh. "Don't worry about it," replied the conductor and went back to his official seat. Anirudh was pleasantly surprised. This was a government bus, and never before had a conductor refused to charge him money for a ticket. He thanked his stars again and decided to buy another box of cigarettes with this 'saved' money, once he reached Mussoorie.</p>
        
        <p>He looked around and saw that there was an old couple seated in the last row. To his left were some young boys huddled together. A few couples are in the front seats, and a small family is sitting next to the conductor. All this was very ordinary, but what seemed absurd to Anirudh was the loud silence. He had traveled a lot in buses and was used to people making conversations, eating, singing, yelling, fighting, and probably everything possible in this setting. But tonight, everyone was sitting quietly in their seats. They were all facing forward and were blankly staring at the road ahead.</p>
        
        <p>"Everyone is probably sleepy and tired from a hard day's toil," thought Anirudh. "Perhaps this is much better than a noisy bus."</p>
        
        <p>He slid his glass window open and could feel the cold air on his face as the bus rushed up the mountain. A young mother was sitting right in front of him with her kid on her lap. The little boy sitting in front of him turned around and stared at Anirudh. He was a cute kid with big eyes and a round face. He couldn't have been more than six years old. Anirudh smiled back. The boy had a doll in his arms. It was a big red colored doll with blonde hair. The boy smiled back at Anirudh. Anirudh was fond of kids and started making faces to make the boy laugh. The boy didn't laugh at all and stared at Anirudh. Then he handed his doll to Anirudh.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>"No-no, I am a little too old to play with dolls," insisted Anirudh, trying to refuse to take the doll from him. But the boy seemed adamant and persisted on handing the doll to Anirudh. After refusing a few times, Anirudh took the doll from him.</p>
        
        <p>"Happy now. I have your doll. Don't you want it back?" asked Anirudh. The boy simply shook his head and turned forward. Not knowing what to do with the doll, Anirudh placed it beside him. Lost in the twinkling lights outside his window, he found solace in the silent company and drifted into a peaceful sleep.</p>
        
        <p>He woke up with a jerk and realized he had already reached Picture Palace. "I must have been really tired," thought Anirudh. He looked around and realized there was no one on the bus. "Everyone must have gotten down. How long was I asleep for?" mumbled Anirudh to himself. He was about to get up when he noticed the doll next to him. "The little boy must have forgotten to pick it up", thought Anirudh. He picked up the doll, hoping to find the boy and his mother outside, and got off the bus.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>It was late in the night. The bus stop was devoid of people. Some taxis were parked parallel to the road. The shops had their shutters down, and the "Welcome to Mussoorie" sign was glittering in all its glory. Thankfully enough, Anirudh spotted a small Paan Shop and decided to buy a pack of cigarettes.</p>
        
        <p>"Bhaiya, 2 Goldflakes please," said Anirudh to the Paan Shop owner. The Paanwala handed him the cigarettes. "Seemed like it was a long day, Bhaiji. A good smoke should do you good," said the Paanwala with a grin. "Yes, I just came back from Dehradun after a long day." The Paanwala was perplexed. "But Bhaiji, where is your car?" "No, I don't have a car; I took the bus," replied Anirudh while taking a drag from his cigarette. The shopkeeper was even more confused now. "But Bhaiji, there are no buses after 9 PM." "Yes, I was also under the same impression, but I was lucky to find that bus," said Anirudh, pointing in the bus's direction.</p>
        
        <p>His cigarette almost fell out of his mouth when he looked back at the bus stop. It was eerily empty. There was no bus over there.</p>
        
        <p>"But-but-but how is–is that possible? I was traveling in that bus. I boarded it at Kuthal Gate. It brought me here," rambled Anirudh. The shopkeeper started looking at him suspiciously. He was used to drunkards stopping by his shop. But this one had cooked up the most interesting tale. "Bhaiji, it's late; I am sure your family must be waiting for you. Go home, why create such a ruckus at night?" "No, I am not kidding; I was on that bus. You have to believe me," yelled Anirudh. "Look-look, I even have a ticket. I'll show you," and he pulled out the ticket from his pocket and handed it to the Paanwala. The Paanwala looked at the ticket disinterestedly, but his eyes widened a little when he read the number on the ticket. The number plate said 'UK 07 6666'.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>"Sixty-Six-Sixty-Six. How is this possible?" mumbled the shopkeeper, transfixed. "How could you have a ticket from this bus?" "See, now you believe me, right? And why can't I have this ticket?" argued Anirudh. "Do you not remember? One year ago, the last bus from Dehradun to Mussoorie was coming up. The driver was drunk; he was driving very fast, missed a corner, and threw the whole bus into the ditch. Zero survivors." Anirudh's eyes widened; he remembered reading about it in the papers. They were calling it the devil's number - 6666. 'No bus should ever be allowed to have such an evil number' was the newspaper's headline last year.</p>
        
        <p>Anirudh looked at the Paanwala, who had started reciting the Hanuman Chalisa and was hastily pulling down the shutters to his shop. Anirudh started trembling with fear. He looked at his other hand and realized that the ticket was not the only thing he had brought back from the bus. He felt the doll staring at him. He tossed the doll behind the Paan Shop and hastily ran back to his house. After reaching his home, he latched the door behind him and quickly slipped into his bed. After trembling for a while, he finally fell asleep.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>In his dream, he saw the little boy holding the doll, staring at him. The dream woke him up, and he couldn't go back to sleep all night. The next morning, he decided not to think about the previous night's incident. He was trying to convince himself that it was just a bad dream. But he couldn't get the little boy out of his mind. The harder he tried, the more he would think about that boy.</p>
        
        <p>Again next night, he dreamt of the boy handing him the doll. The boy kept staring at him, didn't say a word, just looked very serious. This time, Anirudh wasn't scared of seeing the boy in his sleep; instead, he became curious. So the next morning, Anirudh went to the Paanwaala and asked him for some more details about the accident. The Paanwala was a little spooked seeing him again. "Do you know anything about the victims of that bus accident?" asked Anirudh. "I don't know any of them personally. However, all the families of the victims were given compensation by the state government. If you are curious, you can go to the Nagar Palika and find out more information." Anirudh thanked the Paanwala and went about his mission. He pulled some strings and was able to get the list of the victims of that accident. The list had the names, ages, and contact information of all the victims of the accident. Each victim's family had received an ex gratia payment of 50,000 from the state government. After thoroughly going through the list, Anirudh was able to zero down on the boy with the doll. '6 years old - Pinku'. Yes, this had to be it. There was no one that age on the bus. The compensation was given to Rajendra Chauhan. Anirudh knew this must be the boy's father. The address was written too - 'Chauhan Niwas, Camel's Back Road'.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Anirudh decided to meet him. Suddenly, he remembered something. The doll. The boy was holding the doll, and he had given it to Anirudh. But Anirudh had thrown it behind the Paan shop. He hurried to the Paan Shop and started looking for the doll. He knew the Municipality didn't do a great job cleaning garbage from the hills. So he was half sure he would find the doll. After frantically searching for a few minutes, he was able to find the doll buried under some bushes. He wiped it and put it inside a paper bag.</p>
        
        <p>Anirudh left for Mr. Chauhan's house. He was able to easily locate it. He rang the doorbell. A lady in her mid-40s answered the door. "Hi, my name is Anirudh; can I–". Anirudh wasn't sure what to say. Why was he here? The awkward silence was broken by Mr. Chauhan's voice from the living room. "Is it the cable guy? Is he finally here?" The lady stepped aside and asked Anirudh to come in. He didn't say anything and went to the living room. He sat on the couch.</p>
        
        <p>The room was dimly lit, the couch was uncomfortable, and the curtains were drawn. There were cobwebs on the higher corners of the wall. The photo frames on the wall had dust on them.</p>
        
        <p>"You guys took a long time to come this time; I have been calling you all for a week," said Mr. Chauhan. Anirudh paused a little and then said politely, "I am sorry, but I think there has been some confusion. I am not the cable guy." "You are not?" "Then who are you?" "I am Anirudh, I live at Picture Palace." "I am here to talk to you about your son." The mention of his son froze Mr. Chauhan. Suddenly, the stoic face changed expression; his mustache quivered a bit. "What-what about him?" "I am not sure how to say this, but I may have something that's yours." Anirudh pulled out the doll from the paper bag.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Before Mr. Chauhan could say anything, a little girl darted from the bedroom towards Anirudh - "Pari-Pari, you are finally here. I thought you had disappeared just like Bhaiya," and she snatched the doll from Anirudh's hand. She hugged the doll and asked her Dad innocently, "Papa, does this mean Bhaiya will come back soon too?" Her Dad didn't say anything. His eyes welled up. He put his hand on her head. "Go inside, Beta, play with your doll".</p>
        
        <p>"But where did you find this doll? This was with my son that night," spoke Mr. Chauhan with childlike curiosity. "It's hard to explain. I just found it. And I thought you should have it," said Anirudh, expecting more questions to be fired at him. "I am sorry, I have to be somewhere else now. I should be leaving," said Anirudh with some hesitation. "But at least have some chai." "No-no-no, I am getting late. I should be leaving now," said Anirudh and dashed out of the door.</p>
        
        <div class="scene-break">• • •</div>
        
        <p>Anirudh came back to the bus stop and bought a cigarette. He lit it and started thinking about the events of the bus journey. He wasn't sure what to make of it. But returning that doll to the little girl provided him with solace and warmth in his heart. Maybe that night, that boy was trying to send him a message, perhaps he wanted Anirudh to deliver the doll to the boy's sister. He knew that the doll was important to her, so he wanted to send his love to his sister and be there for her, even when he wasn't.</p>
        
        <p>Anirudh went home and slept peacefully that night. The boy appeared in his dream again, but he didn't look grim anymore; he looked peaceful, he looked happy.</p>
